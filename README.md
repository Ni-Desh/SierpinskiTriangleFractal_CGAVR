# SierpinskiTriangleFractal_CGAVR
This code uses OpenGL and recursion to generate the Sierpinski Triangle, a well-known fractal. It repeatedly subdivides a triangle into smaller ones by finding midpoints and drawing three sub-triangles at each recursive step. The pattern progressively appears on-screen up to a specified depth with a short delay between each level for visual effect.
